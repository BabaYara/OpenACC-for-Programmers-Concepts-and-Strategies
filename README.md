# OpenACC-for-Programmers-Concepts-and-Strategies
This repository is populated by proposed solutions to end of chapter execrises from the Book "OpenACC for Programmers - Concept & Strategies". 

This book is a gentler introduction to parallel GPU programing and I highly recommend it. The book is available on amazon at https://www.amazon.com/OpenACC-Programmers-Strategies-Sunita-Chandrasekaran/dp/0134694287.
